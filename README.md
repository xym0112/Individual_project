# Individual_project

All the code related to MedNIST dataset is in the MedNist_classification.py, and all the figures and models are in folders organized by experiments. All the trained models are included, feel free to use model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path)) to load the pre-trained models. 

For the gernal setup, three attacks have been implemented in separate functions, and all fucntion names are self-explanatory.

All the experiments have been commented out for readability, but can be easily accessed by searching 'experiment number' if you wish to see the code. Please uncomment the related section to run the experiment.  

The dataset is stored in bitbuck, and can be accessed in https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wwskxctvcxiuea/MedNIST.tar.gz.
